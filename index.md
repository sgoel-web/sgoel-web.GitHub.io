# About Me
I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India. I earned my PhD jointly from The **University of Melbourne, Australia** and **IIT Kanpur**, India in the year 2017 as a MIPA (Melbourne India Postgraduate Academy) Scholar under the Joint PhD Agreement between the two institutions. I earned my B.Tech and M.Tech (specialization in Geoinformatics) from Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Kanpur under the B.Tech-M.Tech Dual Degree Program in 2011.

Prior to my PhD (2012-2013), I was working as Research Assistant at IIT Kanpur where we developed an innovative technology that enabled scanning of moving objects using LiDAR (refer to [publications](./publications.html) for details).
